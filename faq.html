    <h3>What kinds of books do you accept?</h3>
    <p>We gladly accept used books in all genresâ€”fiction, nonfiction, children's books, educational materials, and more. We just ask that all books be in relatively good condition, free from major damage.</p>


    <h3>Can individuals request books?</h3>
    <p>Our current model is focused on serving institutions like hospitals, shelters, schools, libraries, and prisons. However, individuals may benefit through those organizations themselves.</p>


    <h3>How do you choose where books go?</h3>
    <p>We match book donations with the needs and preferences of partner organizations to make sure each mass donation is as impactful as possible.</p>
