    <h2>Our Story & Mission</h2>
    <img src="Creative Writing Club Photos copy/IMG_6082.JPG" width="500" height="600" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <br>
    <p>We believe in the power of books to uplift, educate, and transform lives. WeDonateBooks began as an effort by high schoolers in the suburbs of Minnesota to spread a love of books throughout their school and community. Since then, through book drive + swap events, we have amassesed nearly 1000 books that we plan to donate to organizations that need them most.</p>

    <h3>Why We Do It</h3>
    <p>Books are more than paper and inkâ€”they're tools for growth, hope, and healing. We focus on getting them into the hands of those who might not otherwise have access: whether its patients, inmates, or kids without monetary resources. We believe everyone deserves a good story and the power of knowledge.</p>


    <h3>How We Work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We collect gently used books through local drives and community swaps.</li>
      <li>We sort and catalog them by genre and condition.</li>
      <li>We partner with organizations to schedule drop-offs or pickups based on their needs.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Our Values</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Devotion:</strong> We work tirelessly to ensure that everyone in our community who wants access to books can get them.</li>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> We believe books should be available to everyone, regardless of where they come from or their financial abilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Community:</strong> We work together to harness the resources and power of everyday individuals to strengthen our communities.</li>
    </ul>
